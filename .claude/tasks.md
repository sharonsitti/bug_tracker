## =ï¿½ Assumptions & Questions

**Default Values:**
- New bugs default to "open" status if not specified
- Severity defaults to "medium" if not provided
- Assignee can be left empty

**Validation Rules:**
- Title: required, max 100 characters
- Description: required, max 500 characters
- Status updates: only allow valid status transitions

**Behavior Questions:**
- Should resolved bugs be editable? (Assumption: Yes, for this exercise)
- Should there be confirmation for status changes? (Assumption: No, direct update)
- How to handle concurrent updates? (Assumption: Last write wins for this simple version)
